# GameEngines1

## Proposal
- For the GameEngines1 assignment I will be making a self-generating forest, my aim is to use Perlin noise for the procedural generation of terrain, this terrain will be populated with trees that will also be placed in a procedural way.

- I am basing this Assignment on the following video series and applying my own to suit my project:  [Procedural Landmass Generation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbpMiKiSKm8).

This terrain generation was intended to be based on unity Terrain, but later changed to be a ground up implementation.

It includes:
-Chunking
-LOD switches for distant chunks
-Threading
-Colliders

Missing Features:
-Texture application

Known Bugs:
-While preparing for texture and material application a bug that makes the planes in the positive coordinate of the user not to show up
